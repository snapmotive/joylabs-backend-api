# Backend Optimizations

This document outlines the optimizations that have been made to the JoyLabs backend to improve performance, reliability, and maintainability.

## Lambda Function Optimization

### Lambda Layers Implementation

The backend now uses Lambda Layers to separate dependencies and reduce deployment package sizes:

- **Dependencies Layer** - Common dependencies like Express, AWS SDK, etc.
- **Square Layer** - Square SDK and related dependencies

Benefits:
- Smaller deployment packages 
- Faster cold starts
- Simplified dependency management

### Lambda Function Separation

Implemented dedicated Lambda functions for specific tasks:

- **Main API Function** - Handles all general API requests
- **Square OAuth Callback Function** - Dedicated to handling OAuth callbacks
- **Square Webhook Function** - Dedicated to processing webhook events

Each function includes only the necessary code and dependencies, further reducing package sizes.

## DynamoDB Table Improvements

### TTL Implementation

All DynamoDB tables now use TimeToLiveSpecification with a `ttl` attribute:

- Automatically removes expired data
- Improves performance by reducing table size
- Reduces storage costs

### Table Naming Convention

Standardized table naming convention with versioning:
- `{service-name}-{table-purpose}-v3-{stage}`

### Data Migration Script

Created a data migration script to migrate data from old tables to new v3 tables:
- Preserves all existing data
- Adds TTL attributes where missing
- Processes items in batches to avoid throttling

## Square Integration Enhancements

### Webhook Processing Improvements

Enhanced Square webhook processing:
- Signature verification for improved security
- Asynchronous processing to respond quickly to Square
- Storage of webhook events for audit and retry purposes

### OAuth Flow Optimization

Optimized the Square OAuth flow:
- Dedicated Lambda function for better performance
- Enhanced error handling and logging
- Improved user experience with better success/error pages

## Caching Improvements

Implemented various caching strategies:

- Connection pooling for DynamoDB clients
- Caching for Square API credentials
- Reuse of AWS client instances

## Security Enhancements

- Webhook signature verification
- Environment variable management with sensitive information protection
- IAM role limited to least privilege

## Deployment Workflow

Updated deployment workflow:
- Automatic setup of Lambda Layers before deployment
- Standardized environment variable management
- Added scripts for common tasks (data migration, layer setup)

## Documentation

- Updated README with new architecture details
- Created documentation for Lambda Layers
- Added migration guides for the v3 update

## Environment Configuration

- Standardized environment variables across all environments
- Added support for new Square webhook signature keys
- Updated local development scripts to match production environment

## Next Steps

Future optimizations to consider:

1. Implement provisioned concurrency for critical Lambda functions
2. Add DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) for read-heavy workloads
3. Set up CloudFront distributions for API caching
4. Implement an automated API key rotation system
5. Add more detailed monitoring and alerting
